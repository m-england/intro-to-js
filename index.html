                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented
                        scripting language When JavaScript was created, it initially had
                        another name: “LiveScript”.

                        (Boring preface) Created in Summer `95 by Brendan Eich working for
                        Netscape.<br />

                        Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a
                        “younger brother” of Java would help.

                        It evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language
                        with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no
                        relation to Java at all.

                        <br />
                        And now...

                        A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property
                        of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to
                        the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary
                        JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The
                        properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.
                        You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:

                        The ECMAScript is still evolving but has certainly
                        stabilized relative to its former self.
                        <br />
                        Languages are built around it like typescript and coffeescript,
                        which aim to shore up the shortcomings of JS.
                        <br />
                        Browsers are better and faster at compiling JS than
                        ever before and have come a long way in the last few years.
                        <br />
                        WebAssembly is the looming "boogeyman" of the JS world.
