                        JavaScript is a programming language that confusingly has nothing
                        to do with Java. JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented
                        scripting language When JavaScript was created, it initially had
                        another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that
                        time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a
                        “younger brother” of Java would help.<br />
                        And now...

                        It's ubiquitous, you probably use it everyday on every device you
                        have. Why?

                        Netscape.<br />
                        But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language
                        with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no
                        relation to Java at all. <br />
                        You can find it in almost every webpage, but it is also used for
                        server applications with node, and electron (mention things like
                        slack and discord).<br />

                        A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property
                        of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to
                        the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary
                        JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The
                        properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.
                        You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
